## Final Competition Day
- You need to deploy your algo in Google Cloud Platform to connect to game server.
- You can fork this repository, modify algo, check-in and deploy into Google Cloud from your github repository.
-  Step-by-step guide to deploy a Java application on google cloud is given below:

## Step-by-step guide

## Setting up a GCP Account

**You can skip this step if you already have a GCP Project

* Go to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and click on **Get Started for FREE**.
* Login using your gmail account, choose your country, accept terms and conditions and click **Continue**.
* In the next step, fill your details, like account type, Name, Address, credit card details, tax information, etc. If you have old Gmail account and all the information is already there it would take it and you might not have to fill all the details.
* After filling all the details click on **Start my free trial**.
* Google will setup your cloud account and in few seconds your Google Cloud Platform account will be ready to start deploying applications on it. It will look like below:

## Creating Github Secrets

* Fork this repository
* Go to **Settings > Secrets** in your forked repository.
* Click on **New Repository Secret** and add Name as **PROJECT_ID** and value as Project ID of your GCP Project and click on Add Secret

![New Secret](/img/secret-project.JPG)

* Again click on New Secret and add Name as **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** and value as contents of json file that you downloaded and click on Add Secret
  
* KEEP IN MIND, not to change Secret Names otherwise you will need to alter workflow in .github/workflows directory

## Deploying the bot

* The workflow to deploy the application is already set in .github/workflows/cloud.yaml file in your forked repo. The workflow can be triggered manually by visiting actions tab in your forked github repo or automatically whenever some code is pushed.
* Firstly, Visit the Actions tab in your forked repo and Click **I understand my workflows, go ahead & enable them**

![Enable-workflows](/img/understand-workflows.JPG)

* Open the workflow by clickng on workflow name - **Build and Deploy to GAE** in this case

![Open-workflow](/img/open-workflow.JPG)

* Trigger the workflow manually by visiting actions tab in your github repo and let Github Actions do the magic.

![Run-Workflow](/img/run-workflow.JPG)
  
* In the Actions tab in your forked repo and open the latest the workflow run and see the progress. You will see something like this when pipeline completes.

![Pipeline-Run](/img/pipeline-run.JPG)
  
* Once workflow is successful, head towards google cloud console and search app engine on search bar, you can see the bot deployed there as default service.

## Checking Logs
  - Go to App Engine > Services and click on Tools in your deployed service and select Logs which will open the logs of application.
  
  - In case if you see the new logs explorer switch to legacy logs viewer by going to OPTIONS> Go Back to the Legacy Logs Viewer

  - You can click on Play button on top to start streaming live logs.

- It might take some time to service to get up and running or logs to load initially

## Happy Coding :smile:
